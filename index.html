                <h2>About Driverless Cars</h2>
                <p>Driverless cars, or self-driving cars, are vehicles that drive on their own without a human behind the wheel. They use sensors and smart technology to move safely and avoid accidents. Companies like Tesla and Waymo are already testing them on the roads, and they are showing good results in making driving safer and managing traffic better.</p>

                <h2>Technology Used</h2>
                <p>Driverless cars use several cool technologies to drive safely:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>LIDAR:</strong> This uses lasers to create a 3D map of the area around the car, helping it see and avoid obstacles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Computer Vision:</strong> Cameras help the car recognize things like people, other cars, and traffic lights.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> This helps the car learn from data and make better decisions over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>GPS:</strong> This keeps track of where the car is and helps it find the best route.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h2>Comparative Analysis</h2>
                <p>Driverless cars have some big advantages over human drivers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fewer Accidents:</strong> They can help reduce crashes caused by human errors, distractions, and tiredness. Some studies say they could cut accidents by up to 90%.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-stop Operation:</strong> They can drive all the time without needing breaks, which is great for businesses that need to transport goods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Better Traffic Flow:</strong> They can drive in a way that reduces traffic jams and makes travel smoother for everyone.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>But, they also have challenges. For example, they might have trouble in tricky situations like bad weather or making tough decisions in emergencies.</p>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>Driverless cars aren’t perfect and have some problems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High Costs:</strong> They are expensive to make, so they cost a lot for people and companies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tech Issues:</strong> It’s hard to make sure they work well in all situations, like avoiding unexpected obstacles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regulation:</strong> Different places have different rules, which can slow down their use while new laws are created.</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Trust:</strong> Many people are still unsure about letting a car drive itself without human control.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Future & Ethical Considerations</h2>
                <p>The future looks bright for driverless cars, with hopes for more safety and better access. But there are some important ethical issues:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> We need to keep the data collected by these cars safe and secure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jobs:</strong> As more cars become driverless, we need to find ways to help people who lose their driving jobs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Equal Access:</strong> We should make sure everyone can benefit from this technology, including people in less served areas.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="col-md-12 mb-4">
                <p>To make driverless cars a success, we need to solve these problems together. Governments, companies, and communities must work together to make sure everyone benefits from this new technology.</p>
